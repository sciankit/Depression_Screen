# Project Write-up (2026-02-22)

## Problem
Depression and related risk states are often detected too late.

## Solution
MoodLens combines wearable biomarkers, risk-tier modeling, and intervention policy logic.

## What We Built
- Multimodal passive signal ingestion
- Databricks model scoring orchestration
- Tiered safety escalation pathways
- Explainability and intervention visualization

## Impact
Early detection plus behavior-first intervention before crisis thresholds.

## Responsible AI
- Non-diagnostic positioning
- Human-in-the-loop escalation
- Consent-driven contact routing
