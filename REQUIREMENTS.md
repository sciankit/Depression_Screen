Project Requirements
====================

There are two use cases for the app:
1. User initiates conversation in the app.
2. App initiates the conversation with the user.

## User Initiated

The user opens the app. He has two options when he opens the app. First is to
listen to some soothing music with or without a guided meditation. Second is to
chat with the app. This chat interface can be over voice or text.

## App Initiated

The app should directly go to the chat interface and ask the user if he is
feeling okay. If not, it should ask him what is wrong. If yes, it should ask him
what he wants to do. If he doesn't want to do anything, it should ask him if he
wants to listen to some soothing music with or without a guided meditation.

# App Interface

The subtle gradient background is good. Keep it.

1. Home screen tab "Today"
Big "Daily Check-in" card on the top. Followed by "2-minute mood check" and
"You weekly vibe arc" card. Finally "You next best actions" card.

2. "Talk" tab
Just keep a simple chat interface.  Do not cluter much. Also give the option to
the user to speak instead of typing. While speaking, show the transcript of what
the user is saying as normal dialogues which he would be typing instead.

3. "Care" tab
This looks good as is. Nothing to change here.

4. "Story" tab
Just keep the "Your Wellbeing at a Glance" section and the "Signals behind your week"
section. Remove everything else.

5. "Plan" tab
This looks good as is. Nothing to change here.
